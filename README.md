# Taxi Game Project

## Overview
This project involves creating agents for a taxi game where the goal is to transport passengers to their destinations and earn points. The game environment is a grid world, and there are various challenges and features in each level.

## Level 1 - Deterministic Task
File: ex1.py

Implement a taxi agent that can navigate the grid world to pick up and drop off passengers.
The agent should maximize points by completing tasks efficiently.

## Level 2 - Stochastic Task
File: ex2.py

Extend the previous level to include passengers with changing goals and limited turns.
Implement a taxi agent that adapts to changing passenger goals and earns positive scores.

## Level 3 - Games
File: hw3.py

Design a taxi game with two competing taxi agencies.
Implement a UCT-based agent using the UCT algorithm and random rollouts.
Create a general agent that implements your chosen algorithm to achieve optimal results.

### Additional Files
- check.py: File that implements the environment and runs the game for evaluation.
- inputs.py: File that contains input data for the game scenarios.
- utils.py: File that contains utility functions for the levels.
- main.py: File responsible for playing the game and evaluating agent performance.
- simulator.py: File that simulates the game environment for the agents.
- sample_agent.py: Sample agent that uses random actions for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started
1. Each level has a specific code file (ex*.py) to modify.
2. Follow the instructions in each file to implement the required agents and functions.
3. Run check.py to evaluate the performance of your agents.
4. Use inputs.py to modify input data for different game scenarios.
5. Utilize utils.py for any utility functions provided in the levels.
